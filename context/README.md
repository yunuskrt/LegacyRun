# Context

These are the context files referenced by the `CLAUDE.md` file. Only the four root-level files are loaded into the AI's memory on startup. The subfolders contain files that are fed to the AI on demand via commands like `/feature` and `/research`.

- `project-overview.md` - Full project spec including features, data models, tech stack and UI/UX
- `coding-standards.md` - Code conventions, patterns and rules for the AI to follow
- `ai-interaction.md` - Workflow and communication guidelines for working with the AI
- `current-feature.md` - Living document tracking the feature currently being worked on
- `todo.md` - Ordered roadmap of upcoming phases and open decisions (not auto-loaded)
- `prompts.md` - Prompt examples of upcoming phases in `todo.md` file
- `AGENTS.md` - Up to date Next.js search to avoid deprecations
- `features/` - Feature spec files used with the `/feature` command
- `fixes/` - Fix spec files for bugs and issues
- `research/` - Research files used with the `/research` command to generate documentation
- `screenshots/` - UI screenshots used as visual references for the AI
